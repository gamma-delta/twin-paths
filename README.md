# Twin Paths

a Minecraft modpack for 1.15.2

---

Welcome to the Twin Paths github repository!

Twin Paths is designed for servers, but can be played on singleplayer. At the beginning, you pick a faction: Tech or Magic. The twin progression trees intersect at certain items and checkpoints, and split apart at other times. There's also crossover, where certain items can be crafted more cheaply using items from the other side.

On a server, the objective will be to race for some sort of MacGuffin. Right now, the pack ends with Elementium for Magic, and Aluminum for Tech.

In singleplayer, you can do whatever you want! You can pick a path, or combine both in weird and wonderful ways.

Check out the wiki (TODO: LINK) for the progression tree and tips! (There's no in-game quest book.)

# Why play Twin Paths?

I find that a lot of hardcore packs have too much power creep. Minecraft has items that are hard to get in vanilla, like prismarine, shulker shells, and scutes. However, a lot of these modpacks make vanilla items trivial to get, and then invent their own difficult materials to keep the difficulty high. For example, a beacon is supposed to be one of the ultimate items. But a lot of packs make beacons and nether stars trivial to get, and require you to automate something that ought to be a great endeavor.

Twin Paths is designed to be anti-power creep. The progression trees follow the progression trees already in Vanilla and the five main mods. There's no ridiculous 9x9 crafting recipes, no Fluxed Hypercholratium Singularities, and no 2,000,000,000 RF recipes. In fact, you won't get electricity until after the End.

Instead, the challenge comes from the challenges already in the game. Twin Paths just makes those optional challenges mandatory.
