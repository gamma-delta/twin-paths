# Twin Paths

a Minecraft modpack for 1.15.2

---

Welcome to the Twin Paths github repository!

Twin Paths is designed for servers, but can be played on singleplayer. At the beginning, you pick a faction: Tech or Magic. The twin progression trees intersect at certain items and checkpoints, and split apart at other times. There's also crossover, where certain items can be crafted more cheaply using items from the other side.

On a server, the objective will be to race for some sort of MacGuffin. Right now, the pack ends with Elementium for Magic, and Aluminum for Tech.

In singleplayer, you can do whatever you want! You can pick a path, or combine both in weird and wonderful ways.

Check out the wiki (TODO: LINK) for the progression tree and tips! (There's no in-game quest book.)
